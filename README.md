# Minitalk
Minitalk is a program that allows a remote server and a client to communicate between themselves.

To see the program's functionin, in order you can.

1) Use the instruction make to create our objectcode from the sourcecode.

2) Run ./server to launch it and so that you get the PID (Process Identification Number)from the server.

3) Run ./client in order giving as first parameter the PID of the Server and as second parameter the string you would like to send on the server.

4) Enjoy seeing the string tipped on the client directly on the server :-)
